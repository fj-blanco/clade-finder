# clade-finder

This is a fork of Provyn's [clade-finder](https://github.com/hprovyn/clade-finder). The CladeFinder is running on YSEQ's website ([YSEQ Clade Finder](https://cladefinder.yseq.net/)) and has been proven to be a useful tool for Y-DNA research.

This fork is intended to be used in my batch processing pipelines to process .vcf and .csv with variant calls. I will document the usage of the repository for such cases as I go along. I will remove the php web app. I will focus on Y-DNA as well, at least in principle.

## Installation

Clone the repository and install the Python requirements into your Python environment:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
